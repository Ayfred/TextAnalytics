After eliminating a developmental writing course and creating an accelerated "Studio" composition course for basic writers, I investigated these students’ needs (uninterrupted time, quiet spaces, social support, and academic help) and the resources that met those needs. Qualitative analysis of interviews with forty-nine students demonstrated that successful students were able to draw upon more resources, including time, space, and social support, than unsuccessful students, who ran short. I theorize, using terms developed by Deborah Brandt, that the literacy of the less successful students was not fully subsidized. These results support basic writing course models that integrate academic, affective, and social support into classroom work.


This essay considers the critical need for pre-service and in-service basic writing faculty to define and enact a professional identity, specifically within the context of faculty development and graduate course settings. The essay describes a graduate course in teaching basic writing offered primarily online with four in-person weekend workshops. As a result, the course has faculty development implications. Key features of the class are professional mentoring through participation in the Council on Basic Writing discussion list, which offers visibility for students as emerging basic writing professionals; creation of Composition Frequently Asked Questions wiki material on basic writing, which serves as a kind of intermediary “publication”; and encouragement to present at conferences and submit manuscripts. The essay also explores the issue of faculty development generally for emerging and current basic writing professionals who are often working as contingent faculty and asks how a professional identity can be developed given these realities.


The author argues that significant progress in destigmatizing basic writing courses and students can be achieved by allowing students to make choices not only about which First-Year Writing (FYW) course best suits their needs through directed self-placement (DSP) but also by offering a variety of course options, including corequisite courses that carry full graduation credit. Drawing from experiences at the author's institution, the article illustrates how certain fortunate circumstances enabled a reconsideration and reframing of FYW curricular offerings and placement methods.
The article concludes with an examination of the unique challenges involved in fully implementing universal choice and provides several examples of how this approach continues to present unforeseen local opportunities for destigmatizing "basic writing."


This article explores the pedagogical implications of translingualism by offering writing theory cartoon as a pedagogical tool to support basic writers’ development of translingual dispositions. In a curriculum that challenges the supremacy of standard English over other languages and modalities, this assignment supports basic, multilingual writers’ representation of and inquiry into their own language practices. Drawing on analysis of interviews, student-generated writing theory cartoons, and written reflections, I discuss how such a pedagogical approach shifts our attention away from textual evidence of translanguaging to surfacing basic writers’ struggles and triumphs in negotiating linguistic, rhetorical and cultural differences, thereby complicating our understanding of translingualism.


Scholars such as Diane Kelly-Riley and Patricia Bizzell have argued that the student writing feature most likely to place a student into a basic writing course is the presence of a dialect other than standard academic English. This essay examines how assessment practices can foster students’ diverse languages rather than inhibit them. I conducted a semester-long participant observation of two sections of first-year writing at Midwestern University, also considered basic writing preparatory courses, in order to examine how instructors assess varieties of English. One of these sections exclusively enrolled nonnative speakers of English; the other section enrolled both native and nonnative speakers. 
A key finding is that students modeled the vocabulary they used to discuss their writing and the writing of their peers to match the assessment language used by the program. Composition scholarship recognizes that language difference and variation are intrinsic to all language; thus, programs should take care to consider issues of language diversity when designing rubrics or other assessment tools to avoid unfairly penalizing students. I discuss one possible model for increased attention to language diversity in assessment.


The Dada and Surrealist movements are known for producing work that challenges reader-viewers’ perceptions of reality. These movements also prompted creators to experiment with unexpected mediums and materials, and this can be seen through the intersection of visual art and writing. This essay emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to the teaching of Basic Writing and proposes an approach that uses the tenets of Dada and Surrealism as starting points for enacting an arts-based, transgenre pedagogy. Focusing on three Basic Writing courses as case studies, the essay explores the benefits of this arts-based pedagogical approach and assignments that require students to engage in art-making and writing simultaneously.


This article argues for the significance of designing writing placement procedures that embrace linguistic diversity within community colleges. Utilizing data on community college writing programs and student demographics from an urban community college, it scrutinizes the prevailing structures of ESL and developmental writing programs at two-year institutions and identifies potential issues with existing models. Furthermore, the article advocates for a translingual approach to writing placement, especially in community colleges with heterogeneous student populations. Such an approach recognizes the intricacies of language use and prioritizes student agency throughout the placement process.


This article argues that the national trend towards replacing developmental writing programs with mainstreaming and corequisite courses presents a significant opportunity to reconsider writing goals and assessment practices for all students. This insight is partially derived from data collected over multiple semesters at one community college, revealing that mainstreamed students in an accelerated learning program often outperform non-developmental students when assessed by the same measure.
These findings raise questions not only about placement procedures but also about prior assessment practices that had mandated more rigorous writing assessments for developmental students compared to those deemed "prepared" for college-level writing. By providing a historical overview of shifting assessment practices at one institution, this article aims to demonstrate how the blurring of distinctions between "developmental" and "regular" writers, stemming from recent mainstreaming efforts, can prompt a constructive reassessment of writing assessment for all students.


This essay, in letter form, introduces graduate-level study in Basic Writing to practicum students. It situates teaching practices within Basic Writing histories and pedagogies, and invites readers to focus widely, read deeply, and keep writing. Included are lessons from Bernstein’s experiences in presenting David Bowie’s artistic and cultural contributions, reading James Baldwin, addressing racial literacy, and becoming a neurodiverse writer and teacher of Basic Writing.

Native Americans are largely absent from the basic writing literature, yet their experiences and identity construction as emerging academic writers offer important insights for college writing instructors. This study addresses previous research on Native American college writers, the legacy of education and writing in Native communities, and the role of cultural identity and the connection between self and writing. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 students who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native enrolled at a public university and two tribal colleges. To generate discussion around writing identity and experiences, participants were asked to draw portraits depicting themselves as academic writers. Six themes emerged as representative of students’ identities as writers. Findings also highlight the influence of culture and community on writing perception, which are triangulated with results from semi-structured interviews with faculty and staff. Recommendations are provided for integrating Indigenous literacies into college composition curricula.




At a four-year public comprehensive university in 2017, a mandated attempt to implement a corequisite model for Basic Writing education challenged assumptions about the types of students enrolled in the existing program. Students, who by institutional placement measures (ACT scores) would be placed in First-Year Writing, were voluntarily enrolling in Basic Writing courses despite administrative assumptions that they did not need the course.
Additionally, I found that students who took AP English and Dual-Credit in high school were also enrolled in Basic Writing. Findings from three years of survey data from students (enrolled in both prerequisite courses and corequisite courses) and institutional data indicate programs need to revise curriculum and placement practices to meet the needs of the students enrolled, rather than the needs of the hypothetical deficient writers institutions presume enroll.


This article writes the histories of CUNY Open Admissions and hiphop toward each other, illuminating both. Bringing Open Admissions to bear on hiphop history helps us see that, while historians locate the birth of hiphop culture in a 1970s New York gutted by divestment and displacement, in fact the decade before hiphop’s birth was characterized by a flourishing Black and Puerto Rican arts scene in New York and the radical education of tens of thousands of students of color in the CUNY system. Revisiting the archives of Open Admissions with a hiphop lens draws attention to the cultural rhetorics education being taught in remedial writing classrooms by adjunct lecturers like June Jordan, Adrienne Rich, and others, who drew students’ attention and inquiry to their own communities and language practices.
Looking at a selection of documents chosen for their use of the term “rappin,” including teachers’ reflective writing, administrative documents, and community writing, this article argues that, as bureaucratic language evolved to disguise racism in the 1960s and 1970s, a resistive, identity-based language of rappin evolved in response. Ultimately, hiphop language only entered the commodity market at the end of the 1970s when CUNY instituted tuition for the first time in its history, pushing out many of the students Open Admissions had been designed to welcome in.
Archaeological investigations of four Acadian settlements have revealed a curiously high number of pairs of sewing and embroidery scissors present at the homesteads. This article examines those artifacts and finds that the high ratio of fine-work tools and the decorative nature of many of the examples reveal a cultural interest in embroidery and embellishment, and a connection to changing European conceptions of genteel feminine accomplishment.
These status signals read differently in the Acadian settlement context, which may in turn have contributed to outside observers’ impressions of the Acadians as indolent and without respect for the structure of colonial authority.


In 1839, in the British North American colony of Prince Edward Island, Tom Williams, a Mi’kmaw man, was convicted of murdering another Mi’kmaw man, Joe Louis, and sentenced to hang. Williams, however, did not hang. This article suggests possible reasons the colonial government chose to commute Williams’s sentence, linking the case to the dispossession of the Mi’kmaq and their subsequent marginalization by settler society as well as the “land question” then dominating the Island.
The case epitomizes the ascendancy of British colonial law and the concurrent weakening of Mi’kmaw law in the colony.


In 1890, the Newfoundland government held an essay contest to solicit opinions on how best to reform its education system. There was widespread acknowledgement that the system was failing to provide a quality education for the colony’s children. The threat to churches’ control over schools led Irish Catholic Christian Brother John Slattery to enter the essay contest. Slattery was victorious, though his win was dubious. He proposed a church-led conservative approach to educational reform, which led to the rise of a cooperative denominational paradigm that entrenched church control over schooling in Newfoundland and Labrador for more a century.


Graham Creighton High School served as a pilot project for integration in the relatively
isolated Eastern Shore area of the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The school, located in
Cherry Brook, opened as an integrated institution in 1964 and served as the space where
students from the surrounding Black and adjacent white communities were brought
together to adhere to the local school board’s policy of integration. But while integration
was the board’s policy, it was often not implemented in practice.

The article looks at Chinese immigrants in Newfoundland, focusing on the restaurants
they opened in St. John’s from 1918 through the mid-1940s. For the Chinese immigrants,
restaurants were paths to economic stability and, for some, a way to establish themselves
as respected members of the community. The restaurants were, however, also contested
spaces, as civil authorities, drawing on racial, gendered, and class-based assumptions,
saw them – and the social interactions taking place within them – as threatening to the
moral order. This history of Chinese immigrants and their restaurants offers a diverse and
complex urban history of St. John’s.


Since the 1960s, there has been a shift in commemoration and museum studies away
from settler-only narratives and towards institutional inclusion of Indigenous and Black
perspectives. While some critics have condemned institutional misuse of decolonization
and diversity, in Nova Scotia there has been meaningful engagement with Black and
Indigenous creators and their communities in the province’s institutions and public spaces.
This is evidenced by the hiring of Indigenous and Black commemoration professionals,
the creation of exhibits and museums/centres that focus on these perspectives, and the
ongoing reclamation of public spaces such as parks, streets, and buildings.


This article focuses on Canadian Mina Hubbard’s expedition through the Labrador-Ungava
Peninsula in 1905. In so doing, it examines the notion of the northern non-Indigenous
explorer/traveller as witness. It considers two practices that were essential to Hubbard in
the construction and performance of her identity as an explorer: empirical observation
and authorship. Hubbard’s efforts to present herself as a reliable northern witness, in
contest with her wilderness guides, also highlight the kinds of racialized, classed, and
gendered identities that were excluded from the work of northern exploration around
the turn of the century.


This piece examines the narrativization of the scars on Prince's back to read a narrative of an alternative humanism, that teaches us out of dispossession as ethics. Sylvia Wynter has argued that under the Western bourgeois order gender and race are a "function of genre." In showing the scars on her back to the culture that produced them, Prince disrupts these genres and no longer remains (only) subject to the white power around her but a maker of alternative and extrinsic narratives about blackness and being that we might read if we wish to do so.


Treatment of European and African hair radically differed in the time of slavery: the former sentimentally preserved in mourning jewelry and keepsakes, the latter shaved off in preparation for the slave-ship hold. This essay considers some examples of how hair functioned as a racial marker. While hair texture was used to establish boundaries between races, hair styling emerged a site of racial contamination where these boundaries threatened to dissolve as white people "frizzled" their hair to make it curly, while Black people shaped their Afro hair so as to mimic the aristocratic hairstyles of white Europeans.


This reflective essay is a report on the series of virtual dialogues on Race, Blackness, and Romanticism I convened as a 2020-2021 Center for Diversity Innovation Distinguished Visiting Scholar. It offers an overview of my discussion with the following: Simon Gikandi and Lisa Lowe, Peter Brathwaite and Paterson Joseph, Christienna Fryar and Jessica Marie Johnson, and Marcos Gonsalez and Travis Chi Wing Lau.


This essay explains why The Woman of Colour cannot assimilate Olivia Fairfield into Romantic-era marriage: a black matriline and Jamaican upbringing imbue the heroine's abolitionism with a racial consciousness white women could not claim. Such an articulate criticism, while necessary for the novel's anti-slavery stance, is at odds with its domestic ideology, which requires instead the translucent, dependent figure of Angelina as the ideal wife. By setting up such a contrast of feminine subjectivities, the novel aligns a global feminist consciousness with women of color rather than the dependent white women associated with British marriage.


I retrace Anne Sancho's creative life in letters through the legacy of her husband, Ignatius Sancho, and the production history of Paterson Joseph's play, Sancho: An Act of Remembrance. An earlier version of the play features an epilogue centered on Anne, but recent productions replaced the epilogue with a commemoration of her husband's historic vote. I consider the erasure of Anne from productions of Sancho in relation to historical framings centered on nationally-bounded stories of inclusion and bourgeois individualism. Anne's presence-absence unsettles these framings and, at the same time, insists that we confront how the U.S. imperial present conjures the British imperial past.


This article explores how burgeoning progressive thinking about racial equality at the turn of the nineteenth century transformed into renewed racism and anti-blackness as the British abolition movement won success. It argues that the evolution of black characters over the nineteenth century, the etymology of arguably the most infamous of racial epithets, and the emergence of the term "white supremacy" during the Romantic period offers a window into how literature and language worked with and contributed to anti-blackness.


Black digital humanities, or Black DH, is less an easily defined field and more a practice or a call to study: how we read, how we think, and how and why we become invested in supporting the ongoing anti-Black systems of the world. In this article, longtime Black DH collaborators Liz Murice Alexander and Kimberly Bain reflect on Black DH's conscientiousmissuses of technology and traditional technoculture. They move from Samuel Delany's Afrofuturist formulations to Alexander's myweakframe digital essay project to think through the work of building new worlds: new spaces, new archives, new collectives for Black thought.


This essay introduces the roundtable on Daniel O’Quinn’s Engaging the Ottoman Empire and briefly discusses the book’s contributions to British imperial history.


In Engaging the Ottoman Empire: Vexed Mediations, 1690–1815, Daniel O’Quinn uses microhistorical methods to construct a constellatory, rather than a cumulative, history of intercultural communication and representation between Ottomans and Europeans. By reducing the scale of his analysis to a singular event, individual, object, or place, he identifies unexpected moments of dissonance, instances of something that does not quite fit. Carlo Ginzburg and Giovanni Levi, both early practitioners of microhistory, called such observations “clues” and used them to complicate grand historical narratives, such as the emergence of modernity. This study proposes that O’Quinn methodologically innovates the use of microhistory by mapping his observations about Ottoman-European intercultural communication in a constellatory field in which each “clue” operates as a dynamic discursive node with many spatial and temporal connections. Throughout his book, he guides readers through this unwieldy spatiotemporal field, from one microhistorical node to the next, and thus models a new approach to tracing the historical and imagined itineraries that linked Europeans and Ottomans across the long eighteenth century.


This essay offers a short reflection on Daniel O’Quinn’s Engaging the Ottoman Empire: Vexed Mediations, 1690–1815. It attends to the forms of historical consciousness that O’Quinn traces within the Society of Dilettanti’s sponsored voyage of William Pars, Nicholas Revett, and Richard Chandler to Asia Minor from 1764–66.


This paper reads Christopher Smart’s Jubilate Agno as a “stuplime” forerunner to experimental poetry, arguing that theories and problems surrounding the avant-garde can help us situate the text as operating somewhere between an archive and a poem. I argue that Jubilate Agno, like many twenty-first-century experimental poems, is an archival project, and Smart’s mechanical ciphers, citations, translations, wordplay, and repetition are formal choices deployed to transcribe natural histories and encyclopedias. This mechanical ciphering strains a reader’s ability to attend to the literal information that Smart transcribes, foregrounding instead the labor of transcription and the idea of information. In other words, Jubilate Agno splits the difference between serving as a useful database and providing an information overload. As I argue, the formal and critical challenges posed by this poem-archive illustrate how eighteenth-century poetic experimentation was predicated on the existence of imperial archives and how this history continues to shape the poetic function of information and mechanism in contemporary poetry. Underlying this analysis is the problem of whether or how eighteenth-century studies can better inhabit its archives and texts—how do we acknowledge history without developing an acquisitive relation to violence, without making violence a commodity within the academy? Rather than answering that question, this essay will consider how Smart’s formal choices, read through an avant-garde approach to information, confront us with it.


This response argues that Daniel O’Quinn’s Engaging the Ottoman Empire uses a methodology from performance studies in order to show the centrality of oral communication to the reconfigured new world order in the wake of the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire. Taking up Diana Taylor’s framework of the archive and the repertoire, O’Quinn analyzes the treaty negotiations as a scenario in which the text is supplemented with the spatial and embodied vocabularies of performance. In doing so, O’Quinn emphasizes the cosmopolitan potential in the imagining of peace before the Western/Eastern dichotomy calcified.


This essay focuses on Daniel O’Quinn’s argument that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu’s letter book can be read as a “counter-epic.” Comparing O’Quinn’s approach to other influential accounts of the role of epic in eighteenth-century literature, it explores how translations of and allusions to Virgil’s Aeneid shape the ways in which intercultural contact can be represented and understood.


Scholars in recent years have attempted to complicate understandings of Robinson Crusoe as an economic man. This essay joins in such efforts by studying how Crusoe actively seeks out and forms close, tight-knit communities with those he meets in order to survive. In particular, I examine the Crusoe trilogy against the backdrop of the trading guilds of eighteenth-century London, tracing how Crusoe employs similar strategies to those employed by the guilds to grow and maintain his membership. Contrary to Ian Watt’s influential claim that Crusoe stands as an emblem of individualism, I propose that Crusoe is more akin to the leader of a group or commune who builds and maintains filiative and affiliative relations through the use of coercion and violence. In the uncertain world that Daniel Defoe has crafted, the production and exchange of goods and the destruction of life and property all count as rational, economic decisions, for these decisions are all made in a bid to ensure the survival of the groups to which Crusoe belongs.


This article situates itself among recent work that focuses on the friendship plot. The emergence of the friendship plot in eighteenth-century literature can be attributed to moral sense theorist Francis Hutcheson and his followers David Hume and Adam Smith, for whom friendship was essential to strengthening the moral sense of the individual and for creating a moral society. The prevalence of the trope of friendship and its related virtues of loyalty and benevolence in the late eighteenth-century novel is evidence of this influence. Recent work on friendship in the early novel has emphasized the importance of equality in these friendship tropes. This article contends that these novels often instead represent complicated asymmetry within British society through socially dependent protagonists. In reading Maria Edgeworth’s Belinda (1801) and the anonymously written The Woman of Colour (1808), this article shows that although the dependent friend protagonist does not act without self-interest, in her ability to elicit sympathy and forge friendships with characters in more powerful positions, she provides opportunities to unravel gender and racial prejudices.


Robert Burns contributed to the collection, compilation, and editing of several song collections, most notably The Scots Musical Museum (1797–1803), although he did not live to see it published. Attribution has proven to be a sticky point of consideration for literary scholars as Burns moved through this conceptual musical museum like a curator: changing, editing, and wholly rewriting sections of song texts to fit his poetic sensibilities. Some tunes were indeed traditional and even Scottish in origin, appearing as they had in earlier collections, while others were almost completely changed, with Burns altering the original text and subverting the traditional message. This, however, had been the traditional art of the ballad maker, and Burns embraced this role, changing both texts and tunes as part of a living, oral tradition. The study focuses on two tunes out of his larger collections, “Greensleeves” and “Ye Jacobites by Name.” “Greensleeves” was a well-known English tune, and “Ye Jacobites by Name” was a ballad that had been used both to attack and justify Scottish resistance to Hanoverian rule. Neither piece would seem to be a particularly promising representation of Scottish culture c. 1800. These pieces, however, highlight an aspect of Burns’s work that not only illuminates his attention to the musicality of these pieces—in an age when most song collections were still printed without notated music—but also his efforts to curate these works, refashioning them to suit a new, proto- Romantic Scottish identity.


This essay argues that The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, the sequel to the best-selling Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, is an argument for early religious education. In the verdant world of Crusoe’s island, we see the importation of religious instruction from Defoe’s The Family Instructor, written only a few years before the Crusoe trilogy. At the outset of The Farther Adventures, Robinson Crusoe departs for his island, leaving his children in the care of his “good Friend the Widow.” Repeating the past, Crusoe deprives his own children of paternal involvement in their religious education, just as his own father had neglected to participate in his own religious upbringing. As the island becomes Christianized by a French Catholic priest and as its inhabitants embrace family life and religious education, Crusoe finds himself an outsider who cannot remain on the island. Unable to join the “circle of Christianity” on the island and unable to resist his compulsion to wander, Crusoe sets off for the “Brazils.” As a result, the lessons of family instruction, transplanted by Defoe into Crusoe’s Caribbean island, have to be taught without the aid of the hero.
