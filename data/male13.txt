This article focusses on the expression of emotion in the writings of Sean 6 Neachtain and his son Tadhg. As such, it represents a contribution to the increasing engagement with the impact of modernity on Irish-language communities in urban settings in Ireland in the period 1700-1850. It differs from previous studies in being primarily concerned with the social inter-relationship of members of the 6 Neachtain family circle rather than with the literary activities of the group of some thirty scholars which had formed around them. It sifts the evidence for close ties between father and son, as well as their relationships with their wives and other close relatives and friends over two generations. While recognising the important role of emotion in the lives of earlier generations, this paper argues the case for increasing emotive sophistication and sensibility, as well as greater willingness to give expression to these feelings, in the lives of the 6 Neachtains. This modern Gaelic worldview with its innovatory acknowledgement of the importance of all individuals, be they men, women or children, pervades Tadhgâ€™s writings in particular, and is to be seen in his fondness for tabulation and his recording of family events. It reflects the impact of concepts of modernity and the enlightenment, with which the 6 Neachtains were in regular contact in the vibrant intellectual atmosphere of the bilingual city of Dublin, 1700-1750.
