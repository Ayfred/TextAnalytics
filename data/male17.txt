The intention of this article is to shed new light on Séamas Mac Póilín [James Pulleine], the often-overlooked eighteenth-century priest and scribe from County Down, and the eleven extant Irish devotional texts to which his name might be ascribed. Of these eleven texts, we are confident that two of them were indeed penned by Mac Póilín, namely a catechism intended for young Irish-speaking Catholics (An Teagasg Criosdaithe Angoidhleig) and a funeral oration delivered in Irish at the death of Eoghan Ó Néill of Bannvale, Clonduff (Oratio Funebris Eugenii Ó Néill). Another text, a translation in the Irish of east Ulster of the Latin text, De Imitatio Christi, had previously been ascribed to Mac Póilín. Determining his authorship of the remaining eight texts (namely eight anonymous Irish sermons), however, is more problematic. All of these sermons are explored in this article, together with the other texts, with a view to not only identifying Mac Póilín as their author but to also highlight their dialectal and linguistic value in the context of the Irish dialect of County Down and of sermon-writing in Irish in the eighteenth century.
