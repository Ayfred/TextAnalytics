This paper considers George Berkeley’s (1685–1753) exclusive and limited conception of toleration for Catholics in the 1730s and how his views fit with those of other advocates of toleration in Ireland at the time by looking at sermons preached by Edward Synge (1690–1762) the younger and John Abernethy (1680–1740). In his early years of service as a bishop of Cloyne, Berkeley drew a distinction between what he called ‘mere Papists’ and ‘Recusants’ and proposed that political toleration only be extended to the former. This corresponded with the idea of freedom of conscience suggested by both Synge (in 1725) and Abernethy (in 1735). Due to their obedience to the Pope in Rome, Berkeley thought that Recusants posed a threat to Hanoverian power in Ireland – at least up to the year of 1745. At the same time, like Synge and Abernethy, ‘the tolerant Berkeley’ argued that Catholics should be persuaded, rather than forced, to convert to the true religion. This was in keeping with his life’s mission of bringing man closer to God.
