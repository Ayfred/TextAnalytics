The author explains how Rand was absolutely correct in saying that Aristotle "stated the formula" of the Law of Identity. He corrects long-standing faulty Thomist criticisms on this issue and gives due credit to thinkers such as Antonius Andreas, Leibniz, and William Hamilton. The author further contends that the gradual shift in Objectivist usage of the Law of Identity (from "a thing is itself" to "a thing is what it is") tacitly ratifies these erroneous criticisms and has actually contributed to the failure of Objectivist thinkers to develop Rand's concept theory into a valid model of propositions and syllogisms.
