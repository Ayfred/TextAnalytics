The right of access to justice is both procedural and substantive in nature. It is procedural because it guarantees availability of certain recourse mechanisms, not necessarily limited to a purely judicial route. It is also a substantive entitlement allowing for the enforcement of the idea of justice as fairness in each unique factual context. The right of access to justice as an attribute of the emerging global citizenship denotes our shared understanding that accountability comes in many forms and shapes, which are becoming gradually available to individuals and grassroots organizations on a global scale. This trend is powered by the technological advancements and the evolution of institutions tasked with ensuring world-wide interconnectedness. This paper critically engages with Thomas Marshall's essay on citizenship published in 1950, arguing that despite several limitations that became apparent in recent decades, this work is an important signpost on the road to building a comprehensive account of global citizenship as a status belonging to all of humanity.
