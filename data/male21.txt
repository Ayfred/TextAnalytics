In examining the generic uncertainty of, and a range of responses to, Lord Orrery’s Remarks on the Life and Writings of Dr. Jonathan Swift (1751), This essay offers new evidence of the ways readers anxiously responded to the early formation of Swift’s posthumous reputation and, more broadly, to the theory and practice of secular biographical writing. This argument here is that the backlash against Orrery’s Remarks, the first extended biographical account of Swift, reveals much about contemporary attitudes to what a literary biography should look like, what it should and should not reveal about the subject, and how it might frame the subject’s legacy.
