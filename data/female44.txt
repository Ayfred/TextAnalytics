This piece examines the narrativization of the scars on Prince's back to read a narrative of an alternative humanism, that teaches us out of dispossession as ethics. Sylvia Wynter has argued that under the Western bourgeois order gender and race are a "function of genre." In showing the scars on her back to the culture that produced them, Prince disrupts these genres and no longer remains (only) subject to the white power around her but a maker of alternative and extrinsic narratives about blackness and being that we might read if we wish to do so.
