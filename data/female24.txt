This essay argues that Practical Education, or, The History of Harry and Lucy, published for private circulation within the Edgeworth family and a small group of acquaintances in 1780, was written by Honora Sneyd Edgeworth. Further, the argument is that Richard Lovell Edgeworth later revised this early story passed it onto Maria, who published it as the first part of Early Lessons (1801). The complicated composition, revision and publication history of this innovative children’s story highlights the collaborative nature of the Edgeworths’ production of children’s stories over a period of several years. In particular, that history reveals the importance of the family for female participation in Romantic literary culture. Nevertheless, familial collaboration effectively masked the identity of the actual author of the first Harry and Lucy story for over two centuries, and so precluded due recognition of the innovativeness of Honora Sneyd Edgeworth’s contribution to children’s literature.
