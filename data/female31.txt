The Dada and Surrealist movements are known for producing work that challenges reader-viewersâ€™ perceptions of reality. These movements also prompted creators to experiment with unexpected mediums and materials, and this can be seen through the intersection of visual art and writing. This essay emphasizes the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to the teaching of Basic Writing and proposes an approach that uses the tenets of Dada and Surrealism as starting points for enacting an arts-based, transgenre pedagogy. Focusing on three Basic Writing courses as case studies, the essay explores the benefits of this arts-based pedagogical approach and assignments that require students to engage in art-making and writing simultaneously.
