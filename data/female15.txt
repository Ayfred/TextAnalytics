This article uses recent scholarship on literary coteries to re-examine Swift’s ‘Triumfeminate’, the Dublin circle of women writers active between 1724 and 1734 that included Laetitia Pilkington, Constantia Grierson, Mary Barber and, occasionally, Elizabeth Sican. The contradictory epithets which Swift’s friends applied to this circle, such as ‘female senate’ and ‘constant seraglio’, point to the complex, malleable and indeterminate spaces that characterise female literary coteries. The rivalry between Barber and Pilkington, both seeking professional status through print culture, coalesced around their respective attempts to appropriate the memory of the scholarly and pious Constantia Grierson, who died young, by publishing her manuscript poems in their own printed works and using her friendship to posthumously validate their own reputations. I will argue that a larger picture of the ‘Senatus Consultum’ (the epithet used by Pilkington of the circle) needs to address not only its female dynamics, but the complex interrelationship between its female writers and male members, mentors, and models such as Swift, Patrick Delany, and Matthew Pilkington.
