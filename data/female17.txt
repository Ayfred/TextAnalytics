This article explores how the Fitzwilliam family’s great Dublin estate was designed and laid out in the period 1725-71. Successive Viscounts Fitzwilliam were unusual in that they employed Catholic agents and actively permitted Catholic tenants on their estate. They also colluded with their Catholic tenants to provide them with as much security of tenure as possible, and allowed their Catholic agents the added subterfuge of subletting some properties and of developing others. When combined with the maps and surveys produced for transmission to London, the correspondence partly reveals what constrained and encouraged Catholic investment in land and property at the height of the penal laws in eighteenth-century Dublin. During this period Catholics and Dissenters were not permitted by law to take leases longer than 31 years and ‘discoverers’ (people who betrayed any illegality to the authorities) were common, benefiting personally from betraying their neighbour. Complex legal strategies, such as collusive discovery, sought to make the identification of the true holder of the land progressively more difficult. The straightforward expression of authorship and patronage, so essential for determining architectural motive and design intent, becomes muddied and concealed by these dissimulating practices of ownership and counter-ownership. The design impact of such complex legal stratgies is a substantially unexplored aspect of Irish architectural and landscape history. The analysis presented is source-led, interdisciplinary and frequently suggestive rather than definitive but aims to reveal a hidden landscape of discovery, Catholic agency and egalitarian suburban space.
