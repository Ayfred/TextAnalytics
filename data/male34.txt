In 1821, Byron took a respite from writing Don Juan, during which he wrote Cain. Cain strives to attain a rationalist understanding of his predicament, which shapes the tragic arc of the play. This paper contends that reading Byron's Cain and Heaven and Earth with Shestov's philosophy of tragedy and insistence on God as a creative rather than rational being highlights the way Cain acts as a foil for the author of Don Juan, illustrating how Byron's poetic practice mirrors the capriciousness of the deity he obliquely represents.
