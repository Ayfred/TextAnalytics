This article refers to blood-drinking of a loved one in the Irish Gaelic Tradition. The motivation for the article was a need to collect the many references to the ritual drinking of human blood in Ireland in one place and examine them in detail. This paper argues that as part of the death rituals associated with keening the dead, and especially if the deceased was a male hero, the drinking of blood was meaningful as an expression of the intensity of grief felt by the female mourners. This article discusses examples of blood-drinking in oral lament poetry from Middle Irish to the modern day, usually by the foster mother, mother, wife or sister of the dead man. It is commonly though not exclusively a woman who praises the dead man in poetry. However, an example from 2011 where a male Irish traveller discusses the death of his son will be studied here for the first time (to my knowledge). This paper also discusses the motif in the eighteenth-century oral composition Caoineadh Airt Ui' Laoghaire. Blood-drinking was not merely a figure of speech or a literary trope in the Irish oral lament. The caoineadh provided an important psychological function as the community returned to normality after the loss of a local hero. The mixing of blood created an everlasting bond between the mourner and the deceased after death. The conclusion is that the native Irish caoineadh and the presentation of the actions of the bereaved, including blood-drinking, formed part of a dramatic performance. The occurrence of blooddrinking in the twenty-first century demonstrates its significance in the Irish ritual of lamenting the dead.
