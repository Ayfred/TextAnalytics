Eoghan Rua 6 Suilleabhain is known as a Jacobite poet, a careful scribe, a tutor and migrant worker. Based on the textual evidence in five of his ‘aisling’ compositions, it may be posited that the poet spent a period of time abroad. Those poems are ‘Ar maidin inne cois ce na slimbharc’, ‘Ceo draiochta’, ‘I Sacsaibh na sead’, ‘Cois taoide maidean greine’ and ‘Ar mo thaisteal la fomhair’, respectively. The poems reveal the significant influence his time in England had on 6 Suilleabhain and how it left its mark on his poetic output.
