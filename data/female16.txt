Literary sociability flourished in eighteenth-century Ireland and encompassed reading parties, private theatricals, book clubs, coteries, and literary salons. Such gatherings and related intellectual pursuits were not confined to the capital, and the papers of those attached to the grand houses of the Irish midlands reveal figures interested in scholarly endeavours and cultural exchange, as well as other aspects of elite sociability. The letters circulated between Castle Forbes and Edgeworthstown House in County Longford, and Charleville Forest in King’s County (now County Offaly) enable us to appreciate the different elements of literary associational life unfolding in the Irish midlands in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries and the various relationships formed there. They allow a new perspective on Maria Edge worth’s own literary criticism and her participation in associational life. The correspondence between these country houses also allows us to appreciate how literary sociability and intellectual pursuits were sustained through family connections, literary correspondence, and an intense circulation of books and manuscript material. The article demonstrates that both the development of women’s intellectual activity and Ireland’s participation in Enlightenment forms of associational life could take place beyond Dublin.
