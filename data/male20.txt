Oliver Goldsmith (1728-1774) wrote across many different genres. However, of his wide authorly scope, much attention has been directed towards his major novelistic, theatrical and poetical works, at the expense of his historical compilations: his two English histories of 1764 and 1771, and his Roman (1769) and Grecian (1774) histories. This article challenges the understanding of Goldsmith as a sort of dilletante when it came to history writing — as someone who only engaged in them for the sake of profit — to instead reveal his deep immersion in the world of Enlightenment historical thought and practice.
