This essay offers readings of four of Lucille Clifton's poems in order to examine her references and allusions to the work of the "big six" British Romantic poets. It proposes that she transforms the writing of these historical authors to serve her own artistic and political ends. In her poems, voices across centuries, continents, races, and genders mingle methodically through a poetics of collaboration that both acknowledges and revises the poetry of these canonical white male poets for contemporary times and for diverse audiences.
