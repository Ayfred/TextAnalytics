This article explores the cultural strategies James Barry (1741-1806) deployed in his writings on art throughout his artistic career. In commercial terms, Barry was a marginal figure who worked in an artistic genre, history painting, in aesthetic and economic decline. However, throughout his literary career, Barry argued for the artistic, philosophical and cultural centrality of the history painter in shaping an enlightened public in late eighteenth-century London. This article examines the various ways Barry drew on historical, political and aesthetic precedents - embodied by diverse literary, mythological and artistic figures - to argue for the importance of the genre of history painting in general and his own history painting work, notably The Progress of Human Culture, in particular.
