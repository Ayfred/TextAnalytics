This article examines patriot sentiment in eighteenth-century Ireland through the developing newspaper press, charting the gradual emergence of a patriot press and the role of that press in articulating a new national identity in the Free Trade Movement of 1779. In describing the role of the press in this political and popular movement, the article explores how individuals and communities collectively expressed a new Irish identity in the Free Trade Protest on 4 November 1779. This appropriation of a Protestant ritual by the patriot nation is evidence of the force of newspaper representations of an imagined Irish patriot nation and the role of ritual and association in allowing diverse sets of individuals, groups, and communities to act out these imagined national identities in reality.
