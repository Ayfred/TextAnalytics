Black digital humanities, or Black DH, is less an easily defined field and more a practice or a call to study: how we read, how we think, and how and why we become invested in supporting the ongoing anti-Black systems of the world. In this article, longtime Black DH collaborators Liz Murice Alexander and Kimberly Bain reflect on Black DH's conscientiousmissuses of technology and traditional technoculture. They move from Samuel Delany's Afrofuturist formulations to Alexander's myweakframe digital essay project to think through the work of building new worlds: new spaces, new archives, new collectives for Black thought.
