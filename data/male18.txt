This article seeks to demonstrate that the anonymous pamphlet, ‘Some Considerations upon the Late Attempt to Repeal the Test Act’ (1719), was written by Jonathan Swift. The argument is based on a comparison with other tracts acknowledged to have been written by Swift; a systematic survey of pamphlets dealing with the sacramental test; an examination of the debates over the Irish Toleration Act of 1719; and a reading of the polemical strategy adopted by the author. ‘Some Considerations upon the Late Attempt’ is the most substantial new work to be attributed to Swift in more than fifty years. It marks a turning-point in his polemical career, and it reveals that Swift’s continuing commitment to the defence of the established church was crucial to his re-emergence as ‘the Hibernian Patriot’ in the 1720s.
