This contribution reorients what Paul de Man calls "the human predicament" in his influential essay "The Rhetoric of Temporality." Colliding de Man's account of allegory and irony with paradigms articulated in Black Studies, it attempts to radicalize de Man's framework by questioning the implicit racial ontology in the "predicament" of self and language he outlines. Because de Man has proven so influential in Romantic Studies, I suggest, by way of a brief reading of Phillis Wheatley alongside Wordsworth, that this reorientation of de Man has implications for a much broader reorientation of Romanticism.
