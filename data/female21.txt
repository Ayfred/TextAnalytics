This article examines what was on the shelves of the medical marketplace in early eighteenth-century Dublin. It does so by analysing the medical cohort in twenty-one auction and sales catalogues, printed in Dublin between 1695 and 1740. It explores this cohort from a number of perspectives: subject, format and language, and in so doing, argues that the Dublin booksellers of the early eighteenth century sought to respond to two growing medical markets: the lay vernacular market, which favoured therapeutic texts in English, and a learned medical market which preferred the costly Latin opera omnia of well-known physicians. An examination of the output of individual bookselling firms suggests that specialization was taking place in the medical marketplace of early eighteenth-century Dublin. In an appendix it provides, for the first time, a full listing of the extant auction catalogues for the period, with the location of original copies.
