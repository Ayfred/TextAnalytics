British and Irish Catholics in the eighteenth century encountered considerable difficulties in respect to the ownership and inheritance of land. Catholic chamber counsel, lawyers who themselves were excluded by law from the bar and bench, provided vital assistance to their coreligionists. One such chamber counsel was Matthew Duane from Clonmel, a distinguished patron of the arts, who practised law outside the courtroom in England. This article explores how Duane came to represent prominent Irish landowners of England and Ireland and, in particular, the 7th earl of Fingall. Paradoxically, one of his Protestant law pupils became a leading opponent of Catholic Emancipation. The article demonstrates how Duane, himself reticent to engage in direct political action, was one of a handful of chamber counsel who functioned successfully to preserve a Catholic interest in property at a time when Catholics were largely excluded from public life and disadvantaged in their private affairs.
