When Britain captured the Cape of Good Hope at the end of the eighteenth century, it was already part of a sophisticated maritime system of strategic and commercial interests. But the first decades of British rule in Southern Africa facilitated the development of another set of connections and exchanges: three of the first four British civilian governors came from Ireland. The governorships of Lord Macartney and Lord Caledon in particular reveal how a geographically disparate community reflecting Irish contacts, concerns and contexts was consolidated using the maritime connections of the burgeoning British Empire. Many of the contacts these men forged, the requests for patronage they attracted, and the news and intelligence they received were a consequence of their Irish backgrounds. Lord Caledon, for example, was at the heart of a set of overseas correspondents that preserved local community connections focused on a small village in south Tyrone. But other aspects of late-eighteenth-century Ireland - mobile, subversive and revolutionary - were also dispersed across this global empire. The upheavals of 1798, for example, reverberated well beyond the shores of the British Isles: Lord Macartney received regular bulletins; army mutinies at the Cape were blamed on ‘Vinegar Hill boys’; and even the gardener accompanying Lord Caledon’s Norfolk pines was a former United Irish rebel transported to Australia. This article demonstrates how the complexities and ambiguities of Ireland’s place in the British Empire were preserved, recreated and reshaped far away from Europe by maritime circuits of communication and exchange. By focusing on the example of the Cape, the discussion illustrates the ways in which eighteenth-century Ireland influenced, and was in turn influenced by, the networks of empire extending across the British World at this time.
