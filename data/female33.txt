This article argues that the national trend towards replacing developmental writing programs with mainstreaming and corequisite courses presents a significant opportunity to reconsider writing goals and assessment practices for all students. This insight is partially derived from data collected over multiple semesters at one community college, revealing that mainstreamed students in an accelerated learning program often outperform non-developmental students when assessed by the same measure.
These findings raise questions not only about placement procedures but also about prior assessment practices that had mandated more rigorous writing assessments for developmental students compared to those deemed "prepared" for college-level writing. By providing a historical overview of shifting assessment practices at one institution, this article aims to demonstrate how the blurring of distinctions between "developmental" and "regular" writers, stemming from recent mainstreaming efforts, can prompt a constructive reassessment of writing assessment for all students.
