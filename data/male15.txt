This article focuses on the figure of Paddy who came to serve as the male personification of the Irish nation in the late eighteenth century. While much work has focused on British representations of Irishness in the nineteenth century, there has been little attempt to examine earlier ways in which the Irish themselves mobilised this figure in this formative period for understandings of national identity. This article argues that new understandings of Irishness and Irish national identity were articulated through representations of Paddy. Initially a stereotype in the tradition of the stage Irishman, during the ‘free trade’ dispute Paddy was adopted in a range of media such as engravings, ballads, and on the stage to represent a unified, assertive nation in opposition to British policies restricting Irish trade. By the 1790s, Paddy was central to the symbolism of the radical United Irishmen, featuring in the title of a popular collection of ballads, Paddys Resource. It examines the changing nature of Paddy in the late eighteenth century, from the feckless stage Irishman to industrious peasant and his shifting place in understandings of national identity and notions of Irishness.
