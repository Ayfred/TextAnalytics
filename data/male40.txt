This review of Daniel O’Quinn’s Engaging the Ottoman Empire focuses on his analysis of visual art within a media framework. I focus particular attention on chapters 2 and 3, which foreground the Ottoman paintings of Jean Baptiste Vanmour in the first third of the eighteenth century. Noting the challenge of integrating oil painting into media analysis, the review notes the book’s successful deployment of close visual analysis in a sophisticated social history of art.
