This article considers Maria Edgeworth’s unpublished 1799 essay advocating mass education in Ireland in relation to her tales for children published in the immediate aftermath of the 1798 uprising. For Edgeworth, the education of the poor, granting wider access to print culture and enabling the free circulation of ideas, promised the emergence of a new political nation without violent revolution. Through the creation of a reading public, Edgeworth sought a solution to conflict. Her writing for and about children post-1798 propagates a culture of book-reading, thinking, and invention, and was an extension of her commitment to mass education. The child characters who populate Edgeworth’s tales may be read allegorically as representatives of an Irish adult working class that had been infantilized and subjected to unjust repression, but rather than enjoining submission to adult authority, Edgeworth makes heroes of her inventive and resilient child protagonists, imagining through them alternative futures for the Irish nation.
