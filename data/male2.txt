This essay explores Protestant depictions of Irish history in sermons preached from the 1730s to the 1790s before the Incorporated Society in Dublin for Promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland and its sister body, the London Society Corresponding with the Incorporated Society in Dublin. ‘Working schools’, where the children of Catholic parents were reared as Protestants, seemed to the Societies’ supporters spearheads for Ireland’s spiritual and temporal renewal, and the preachers — all eminent figures in the Church of Ireland or the Church of England — set that regeneration in a perceived historical context. They deplored the ‘barbarity’ of Ireland’s past, the baneful impact of ‘Popery’ over centuries, and the deficiencies of Ireland’s traditional economy and society. They praised English rule in Ireland, expounded the role of Providence in Irish history, and, displaying both optimism and pessimism about the condition of eighteenth-century Ireland, sketched visions of the kingdom’s future. Collectively, the sermons provided justifications for the Protestant Ascendancy and blueprints for the English and Protestant ‘improvement’ of Ireland.
