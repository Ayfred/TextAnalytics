The aim of this paper is to introduce a hitherto un-acknowledged incidence of British parliamentary intervention in Gardiner’s Relief Act (1778) in Ireland and to demonstrate how subscription-list analysis can be used as a tool to convey a political message. The central focus of this paper is the unparalleled appearance of twenty members of Britain’s governing political elite supporting via subscription A General History of Ireland, a polemical work by the Irish-Catholic antiquarian Sylvester O’Halloran published in London in June 1778. This paper will argue that the unprecedented appearance of a British political coterie in the subscription-list of this work was a deliberate intervention to encourage the passage of Gardiner’s Relief Act in Ireland by demonstrating British parliamentary support for the measure via O’Halloran’s subscription-list, and moreover, that the orchestration of this list took place within the imperial corridors of power.
