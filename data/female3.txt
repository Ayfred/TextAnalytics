A hoard containing five gold lunulae of Early Bronze Age date was found in north Co. Kildare in 1859. Although this hoard is better recorded than most others of the period, it has been mistakenly provenanced. This paper examines all relevant archival sources to re-establish the find place, the circumstances of discovery, the dispersal of the hoard, and its reconstitution. Most of the lunulae in this hoard belong to a particular sub-type which is examined and discussed. Fragmentation and manipulation of lunulae during their period of use and prior to deposition are also discussed. An appendix listing 76 extant lunulae from Ireland is also provided, with notes on new or corrected provenances where available.
