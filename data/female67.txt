This article argues that there is an elemental confluence between the moral ideal of cosmopolitanism and the economic and commercial practices of globalization. By looking at Foucault’s and Arendt’s readings of Kant, I show that the cosmopolitan premise of humanity is bound to an eschatological vision of the end of politics. In aligning Foucault’s discussion of state-phobia with Arendt’s discussion of world alienation, I argue that the eclipse of the public realm is intrinsic to the liberal conception of progress. While critics have viewed Arendt’s social/political distinction with suspicion, less attention has been paid to the parallel contrast between intimacy and privacy in her work and to the ways in which her critique of intimacy’s worldlessness converges with her depiction of the crisis of modernity. In Arendt’s account, the social swallows up and depoliticizes the public realm and spits out intimacy (limitless interiority) as the consolation for this loss.
