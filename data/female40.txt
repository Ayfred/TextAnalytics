Graham Creighton High School served as a pilot project for integration in the relatively
isolated Eastern Shore area of the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The school, located in
Cherry Brook, opened as an integrated institution in 1964 and served as the space where
students from the surrounding Black and adjacent white communities were brought
together to adhere to the local school board’s policy of integration. But while integration
was the board’s policy, it was often not implemented in practice.
