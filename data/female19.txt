This article examines the economic writing of Jonathan Swift as a counter to the dominant mercantilist theories of contemporary English economic literature and policy. It is argued that Swift promotes an alternative set of policies that advance Ireland’s growth through local consumption, production, and development rather than through external trade. Instead of pursuing mercantilist goals of a positive balance of trade, bullion, and military power, Swift encourages Ireland to pursue demand-driven growth. Swift’s diagnoses of Ireland’s problems and his proposed solutions, especially regarding money and consumption, offer possibilities for economic action more appropriate for Ireland’s situation than the standard mercantilist beliefs and policies. It is also demonstrated that Swift’s policy prescriptions are based on a consistent economic philosophy that focuses on improvements in the quality of life of Irish households rather than the accumulation of financial and military power.
