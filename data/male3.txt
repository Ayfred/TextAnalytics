Unlike England and Wales - but like many other European countries at the time -eighteenth-century Ireland did not have a national system of poor laws. In 1772, the Parliament passed legislation which would have seen houses of industry established throughout Ireland. However, as this was subject to local initiative, in fact only a small number of houses of industry were founded. There has been little study of the reasons why Parliament, generally seen as unsympathetic to the plight of the poor, adopted this legislation. Richard Woodwardâ€™s contemporary publications on relief of the poor are often cited as the inspiration for the legislation but this does not explain why Parliament chose to act in the 1770s. Nor has there been much work on the reasons why certain poor houses were established. Consequently, the article examines two key issues: why the legislation was adopted in 1772; and where and why it was implemented (or not implemented) in the following decades.
