This article uses the career of Sir Richard Cox, a prolific pamphleteer and MP for the Co. Cork borough of Clonakility, to provide a case study of mid-eighteenth-century Irish patriotism. It analyses Cox’s pamphlets, his involvement in political disputes, his record as an MP, his commitment to economic improvement and his management of his Dunmanway estate. In doing so, the article attempts to resolve some of the difficulties with interpreting patriotism, in particular the problem of balancing political principle with opportunism and careerism. The article also seeks to determine how far Cox represented a practical strand of patriotism, where the main concern was with solving Ireland’s economic problems rather than constitutional issues. In order to establish whether Cox’s patriotism was representative of a wider contemporary mood, the article assesses his activities in the context of pamphleteering and parliamentary output in mid-eighteenth-century Ireland.
