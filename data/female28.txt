The author argues that significant progress in destigmatizing basic writing courses and students can be achieved by allowing students to make choices not only about which First-Year Writing (FYW) course best suits their needs through directed self-placement (DSP) but also by offering a variety of course options, including corequisite courses that carry full graduation credit. Drawing from experiences at the author's institution, the article illustrates how certain fortunate circumstances enabled a reconsideration and reframing of FYW curricular offerings and placement methods. The article concludes with an examination of the unique challenges involved in fully implementing universal choice and provides several examples of how this approach continues to present unforeseen local opportunities for destigmatizing "basic writing."
