This essay proposes that Romantic studies needs to overhaul its canonical theories of language in order to contend with the rhetoric of racialization that underwrites and sustains structures of antiblackness. Scholarship often casts the apparent instability of race in the period as potentially liberatory, having derived its ideas about rhetoricity from the tradition of rhetorical deconstruction. Arguing that this tendency is both historically and theoretically misguided, the essay identifies an alternative model of rhetorical reading in the work of Hortense Spillers and develops its implications through analyzing a couplet from Mary Robinson's "The Negro Girl" (1800).
