In 2012, I came across The Face of Madness: Hugh W. Diamond and the Origin of Psychiatric Photography (1976) and had a crucial encounter with a photograph by Hugh Welch Diamond's c. 1855 of a patient at the Surrey County Asylum in England (plate 34). From the photo looking at me was my younger self and this encounter led me to a project seeking to contribute to envisioning the political, cultural, gendered, and psychic conditions of possibilities of "return" with its numerous inflections: returning to the Asylum, to another era, to the 19th century, returning to the site of a traumatic experience, the return of the suppressed, the right to return, the phenomenon of psychoanalytical regression, etc. This inspired me to begin several projects, which explores and questions photography's ability to penetrate traumatic experience, attempting to create a new community, comprised of dozens of women, asylum-seekers, activists, artists, etc. (1885-2019).
