This essay, in letter form, introduces graduate-level study in Basic Writing to practicum students. It situates teaching practices within Basic Writing histories and pedagogies, and invites readers to focus widely, read deeply, and keep writing. Included are lessons from Bernstein’s experiences in presenting David Bowie’s artistic and cultural contributions, reading James Baldwin, addressing racial literacy, and becoming a neurodiverse writer and teacher of Basic Writing.
