John Toland’s 1720 Pantheisticon might seem most notable for its mockery of liturgical practice; but the ‘burlesque’ aspects of its form belie a profound – and yet virtually unrecognized – engagement with contemporaneous science. Specifically, and as I want to show here, some of the most conceptually important sections of the Pantheisticon look to integrate scientific speculation with Toland’s wider materialistic, monistic, philosophical understanding. The success of this engagement is no doubt open to question. But what seems beyond dispute is that the Pantheisticon provides further evidence of Toland’s remarkable ability to marshal the intellectual resources of his time for his wider, philosophical, project. In order to make this case, my paper is divided into four parts, followed by a conclusion. First, I sketch an outline of the kind of ‘vitalism’ that had gained intellectual traction by the time Toland composed the Pantheisticon, as I want to show, solely mechanistic understandings of the physical realm were supplemented by a range of important notions, regarding ‘Energy’ and ‘Force’. Next, I sketch some general outlines of the increasingly historical, or historicized, depiction of nature that – in a related but distinct development – had begun to stress chronological change as central in understanding life on Earth. With this bipartite context established, I then turn to the Pantheisticon itself, reading central aspects of it in terms of these two distinct currents – namely, ‘vitalism’ and ‘natural history’. When we consider, as well, that Toland utilizes these two currents without any regard for their original, ‘physico-theological’, setting, we can begin to appreciate more clearly the significance of the Pantheisticon’s engagement with the science of its time: Toland’s purpose, I suggest, is about exploiting significant yet pious scientific insights for a wider – and thoroughly impious – philosophical project.
