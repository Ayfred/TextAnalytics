Hugh Boulter, Archbishop of Armagh and a leading figure in the early Hanoverian Irish government (1724-42), is remembered by historians chiefly for his promotion of ‘the English interest’ in church and state. This article suggests a more complex view. It examines his English background, in particular his editorship of the Whig journal, The Freethinker, and his connections with the other editors, two of whom also came to Ireland with him, Richard West (as Lord Chancellor) and Ambrose Philips. It explores the immediate political context of his appointment at a time of mounting opposition to Walpole’s government, which included an Irish ‘patriot’ opposition articulated, for some, by Jonathan Swift. It considers the extent to which an Irish Toryism, often thought moribund, survived in this opposition. Finally it discusses the interplay of Whig, Tory and Trish patriot’ elements in conflicts in the Irish church, especially over the English Whig plan to abolish Ireland’s Sacramental Test, and the complex role played by Boulter in this. Overall this article suggests that the conflicts of Boulter’s Irish career arose not only from ‘national’ or Irish/ English opposition, but from party politics, from divisions between Whig and Tory and between different varieties of Whiggism.
