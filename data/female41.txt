The article looks at Chinese immigrants in Newfoundland, focusing on the restaurants
they opened in St. John’s from 1918 through the mid-1940s. For the Chinese immigrants,
restaurants were paths to economic stability and, for some, a way to establish themselves
as respected members of the community. The restaurants were, however, also contested
spaces, as civil authorities, drawing on racial, gendered, and class-based assumptions,
saw them – and the social interactions taking place within them – as threatening to the
moral order. This history of Chinese immigrants and their restaurants offers a diverse and
complex urban history of St. John’s.
