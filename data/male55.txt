This paper suggests how the antiquarian interests of Captain Ralph Ouseley, resident in Limerick from the 1760s until his death in 1803 and a founder member of the Royal Irish Academy, shaped the careers of his three sons. Each travelled to India and two, Gore and Joseph Walker, found long and profitable employment there. The third and eldest, William (1768–1842) is the main focus of this account. As a youth, William Ouseley accompanied his father on antiquarian excursions in the west of Ireland where he applied his talents as a topographical artist. Soon, however, his curiosity shifted towards India and Persia, translating and publishing works in their languages, and becoming a voracious collector of manuscripts, artefacts and texts originating in the sub-continent. William Ouseley, although respected for his expertise by contemporaries and being knighted, failed to gain any remunerative official appointment. His sole visit to Asia only occurred in 1810. Nor did he participate in the fierce controversies generated by Vallancey about the possible linkages between the peoples and languages of Asia and of Ireland. Ouseley’s later life was passed in England, Wales and continental Europe, but the formative influence in Ireland of his father’s tutelage and collections, which included oriental elements, is suggested.
