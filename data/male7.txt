The Amazoniad (1806), a mock-heroic poem in five cantos written in the style of Alexander Popeâ€™s verse satires, lampoons Dublin society in the aftermath of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. In it John Wilson Croker, regarded as one of the founders of the modern Conservative party, attacks the newly formed Whig government and its local representative, the lord lieutenant of Ireland and his court. Central to The Amazoniad (which has not received any critical attention until now) is the notion of performance: one of its two main episodes takes place in a theatre, and a principal object of its satire is the performance the Whigs are supposedly putting on to both overawe and mollify the Irish people, who were largely in a state of nervous uncertainty and discontent after the tumultuous events of the previous few years (the United Irishmen Rebellion of 1798 and the permanent dissolution of the Irish Parliament in 1800). The poem sheds light on a particularly anxious moment of Irish life and offers evidence that the influence wielded by some women during the period of an independent Irish Parliament had already contracted by the early days of the Union.
